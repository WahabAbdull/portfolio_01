Manual spraying depends on user effort and is often neglected, leading to unpleasant odors. Electronic air fresheners increase cost, require regular battery replacement, and may fail due to moisture exposure. These limitations make existing solutions inefficient, unreliable, and unsuitable for long-term hygienic use in shared environments. Solution: The proposed flush-driven aerosol air freshener eliminates these issues by using a fully mechanical mechanism integrated with the toilet flush system. When the flush lever is activated, motion is transmitted through a flexible shaft to a set of rods and a spring-loaded actuator that presses the aerosol button. This ensures automatic and consistent fragrance release on every flush without electrical power, reducing maintenance while improving hygiene. Functions (How it works?): Transfers flush lever motion using a flexible shaft Converts motion through a rod-based mechanical linkage Presses the aerosol can nozzle using a spring-loaded rod Automatically resets after each flush cycle Benefits: Provides hands-free and automatic air freshening Operates without electricity or batteries Low maintenance and durable mechanical design Cost-effective compared to electronic dispensers Applicable to universal English-type commode flush systems Compatible with universally available aerosol air freshener cans Suitable for residential and public washrooms Precautions: The mechanism and holder must be installed below the flush tank to ensure proper motion transmission. The applied maximum force on the mechanism should be 5N (FEA analysis) The flexible shaft should be routed smoothly without sharp bends to ensure reliable operation.
